# RTP forwarder with WebRTC

this example is base on [rtp-forwarder](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/blob/master/examples/rtp-forwarder/README.md).

## How to run

Starting the server first:

```bash
make server
```

Starting the client:

```bash
make cli
```

Optionally, you can also open `http://localhost:9090` in your browser instead of `cli`.
